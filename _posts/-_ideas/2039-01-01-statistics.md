## List of Articles About Statistics

- **TODO: Introduction to Probability Theory**
   - A foundational article that explains the basics of probability theory, including concepts like random events, probability distributions, and conditional probability. It explores applications in real-world scenarios such as gambling, risk assessment, and decision-making under uncertainty.

- **TODO: Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing Data with Mean, Median, and Mode**
   - This article covers the core concepts of descriptive statistics, including how to calculate and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and variability (range, variance, and standard deviation). Visualizations like histograms and box plots are also discussed.

- **TODO: Inferential Statistics: Drawing Conclusions from Data**
   - Learn about inferential statistics, the branch of statistics that deals with making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample. This article covers key topics like sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

- **TODO: Hypothesis Testing: Understanding p-Values and Statistical Significance**
   - A deep dive into the process of hypothesis testing, including null and alternative hypotheses, the meaning of p-values, and the concept of statistical significance. The article explains how to perform and interpret common statistical tests, such as the t-test and chi-square test.

- **TODO: Regression Analysis: Exploring Relationships Between Variables**
   - Regression analysis is a powerful statistical tool used to explore relationships between variables. This article focuses on simple and multiple linear regression, discussing how to fit a regression model, interpret the coefficients, and assess the goodness of fit.

- **TODO: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Comparing Means Across Multiple Groups**
   - Learn about ANOVA, a method used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if at least one group is significantly different from the others. The article covers one-way and two-way ANOVA, as well as assumptions and interpretation of results.

- **TODO: Probability Distributions: Normal, Binomial, and Poisson**
   - Explore the key probability distributions that form the foundation of statistical analysis. This article explains the characteristics of normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions, along with examples of their real-world applications in fields like quality control and biology.

- **TODO: Bayesian Statistics: An Introduction**
   - An introductory article on Bayesian statistics, which differs from traditional (frequentist) approaches by incorporating prior beliefs and evidence into the analysis. This piece covers Bayesâ€™ Theorem, prior and posterior distributions, and applications in decision-making.

- **TODO: Chi-Square Test: Testing Categorical Data**
   - This article explores the chi-square test, a statistical method used to examine the association between categorical variables. It covers both the chi-square test for independence and the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, with examples of how to apply these tests in practical situations.

- **TODO: Statistical Power and Sample Size: Designing Effective Studies**
   - Learn about the concepts of statistical power and sample size, which are critical in designing experiments and studies. The article explains how to calculate the necessary sample size for a study and the importance of achieving sufficient power to detect a true effect.

- **TODO: Time Series Analysis: Modeling Data Over Time**
   - This article delves into time series analysis, focusing on methods used to model and forecast data that is collected over time. Topics include autocorrelation, stationarity, ARIMA models, and applications in fields like economics, finance, and climate science.

- **TODO: Nonparametric Methods: Statistics Without Distribution Assumptions**
   - Learn about nonparametric statistical methods, which are used when the data does not meet the assumptions of parametric tests. The article covers common nonparametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
