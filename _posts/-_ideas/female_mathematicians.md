## List of Notable Female Mathematicians

- **TODO: Hypatia of Alexandria (c. 360–415 CE)**  
  - One of the earliest recorded female mathematicians, Hypatia made significant contributions to **geometry** and **astronomy**. She was also a prominent philosopher and teacher in ancient Alexandria.

- **TODO: Sophie Germain (1776–1831)**  
  - A trailblazer in **number theory** and **elasticity theory**, Sophie Germain made critical contributions to Fermat's Last Theorem and was the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her work on elasticity.

- **TODO: Ada Lovelace (1815–1852)**  
  - Often considered the world’s first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace worked on **Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine** and wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Her visionary ideas foreshadowed modern computing.

- **TODO: Mary Somerville (1780–1872)**  
  - Known for her work in **astronomy** and **mathematical physics**, Mary Somerville was one of the first women to be recognized as a scientist in her era. Her writings made science accessible to a broader audience.

- **TODO: Emmy Noether (1882–1935)**  
  - A groundbreaking mathematician, Emmy Noether made monumental contributions to **abstract algebra** and **Noether's Theorem**, which is fundamental in linking symmetries and conservation laws in physics.

- **TODO: Grace Hopper (1906–1992)**  
  - A pioneer in **computer science** and **mathematics**, Grace Hopper developed the first compiler for computer languages and played a significant role in the creation of COBOL. She also coined the term "debugging" for fixing computer issues.

- **TODO: Julia Robinson (1919–1985)**  
  - Known for her work in **decision problems** and **number theory**, Julia Robinson contributed to solving **Hilbert's Tenth Problem**. She was the first woman to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S.

- **TODO: Katherine Johnson (1918–2020)**  
  - A mathematician who worked at NASA, Katherine Johnson was instrumental in calculating trajectories for the **Mercury** and **Apollo space missions**. Her work in **applied mathematics** was crucial to the success of U.S. space exploration.

- **TODO: Mary Cartwright (1900–1998)**  
  - A pioneer in **nonlinear differential equations** and **chaos theory**, Mary Cartwright made significant contributions to applied mathematics and her work paved the way for modern developments in chaos theory.

- **TODO: Dorothy Vaughan (1910–2008)**  
  - A mathematician and computer scientist, Dorothy Vaughan was an expert in **FORTRAN programming** and worked at NASA as a leader in the computing division during a time when women and African Americans faced significant barriers.

- **TODO: Shafi Goldwasser (1958–Present)**  
  - A contemporary mathematician and computer scientist, Shafi Goldwasser is known for her work in **cryptography** and **complexity theory**. She has received the **Turing Award**, the highest honor in computer science.

- **TODO: Ingrid Daubechies (1954–Present)**  
  - Ingrid Daubechies is famous for her work on **wavelets** in signal processing and **image compression**. Her research has had profound applications in both mathematics and engineering.

- **TODO: Karen Uhlenbeck (1942–Present)**  
  - Known for her work in **geometric analysis** and **partial differential equations**, Karen Uhlenbeck was the first woman to win the prestigious **Abel Prize** in mathematics, awarded for outstanding scientific work.

- **TODO: Evelyn Boyd Granville (1924–2023)**  
  - One of the first African-American women to earn a PhD in mathematics, Evelyn Boyd Granville worked on the U.S. space program and made significant contributions to **computer programming** and **numerical analysis**.

- **TODO: Marjorie Lee Browne (1914–1979)**  
  - A mathematician and educator, Marjorie Lee Browne was one of the first African-American women to receive a PhD in mathematics. She worked on **mathematical education** and contributed to advancing African-American participation in mathematics.
