## Appendix: TODO List of Models for Wealth Distribution and Inequality

- TODO: **Explore Agent-Based Models (ABM)**  
  - Simulate individual interactions with rules for wealth exchanges, consumption, and savings.
  - Analyze emergent global patterns like wealth inequality.
  - Test economic policies (e.g., taxes) for effects on inequality.

- TODO: **Study Pareto Distribution Model**  
  - Investigate how a small portion of the population holds a large share of wealth (Pareto's Law).
  - Focus on heavy-tailed distributions for the wealthiest individuals.
  - Analyze real-world data to validate the model.

- TODO: **Apply Stochastic Models**  
  - Model wealth accumulation and redistribution as random processes.
  - Use stochastic differential equations to simulate wealth fluctuations.
  - Examine how random interactions contribute to equilibrium or persistent inequality.

- TODO: **Implement Markov Chain Models**  
  - Track transitions between different wealth states (e.g., poor, rich) using probabilities.
  - Explore how future wealth depends only on current state (memorylessness).
  - Simulate long-term transitions to study wealth mobility.

- TODO: **Analyze Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient**  
  - Plot the cumulative distribution of wealth for different population segments.
  - Calculate the Gini coefficient to measure wealth inequality.
  - Compare Lorenz curves across different economies to visualize inequality.

- TODO: **Study Boltzmann-Gibbs Distribution (Econophysics)**  
  - Model wealth distribution using analogies from statistical mechanics.
  - Analyze how wealth is exchanged randomly between individuals.
  - Study the exponential distribution of wealth for most individuals, with Paretoâ€™s law for the top.

- TODO: **Examine Kinetic Wealth Exchange Models**  
  - Model wealth exchanges between individuals like energy exchanges between particles.
  - Analyze how random pairwise exchanges affect overall wealth distribution.
  - Explore conservation laws to see how wealth remains constant but is redistributed.

- TODO: **Investigate Game-Theoretic Models**  
  - Model strategic interactions where individuals decide on savings, investments, and consumption.
  - Analyze how equilibrium strategies lead to wealth outcomes.
  - Study the effects of strategic behavior on long-term inequality.

- TODO: **Explore Endogenous Growth Models**  
  - Study how wealth grows due to internal factors like innovation and education.
  - Model how wealthy individuals benefit more from growth opportunities.
  - Investigate feedback loops that reinforce inequality.

- TODO: **Implement Wealth and Income Shock Models**  
  - Model the effects of random shocks (e.g., unemployment, health crises) on wealth.
  - Simulate how different wealth classes recover from shocks.
  - Study how shocks exacerbate or mitigate long-term wealth inequality.

Each of these TODO items represents a different model or approach to understanding wealth distribution and inequality, offering various ways to simulate and analyze economic outcomes.
