## Abstract

Zero-inflated time series data, characterized by an excessive number of zero observations, pose significant challenges in statistical analysis and classification. Traditional threshold determination methods, such as percentiles and standard deviation intervals, often fail to provide meaningful classifications in these contexts due to the skewness introduced by the zeros. This paper presents a generalized methodology for threshold classification applicable to zero-inflated time series data across various domains. By combining data preprocessing techniques, quantile-based classification, clustering algorithms, and statistical modeling, the proposed approach enhances the accuracy and generalizability of event intensity classifications. Applications to precipitation data, wind speed, traffic volume, and financial transactions demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of this methodology.

## 1. Time Series Data and Zero Inflation

### Background

Time series data are vital across multiple fields, including meteorology, finance, and transportation. Analysts use these datasets to detect patterns, forecast events, and inform decision-making. A key challenge in time series analysis involves classifying event intensities, such as rainfall levels or traffic flow volumes. Correct classification is crucial for policy-making, resource allocation, and emergency preparedness.

However, many time series datasets contain a large proportion of zero values. These "zero-inflated" datasets emerge when events occur sporadically or when measurements fall below the detection threshold of the instrument. Examples include:

- **Precipitation**: No rainfall recorded for long periods.
- **Wind Speed**: Periods of calm.
- **Traffic Volume**: Times with no vehicles passing.
- **Financial Transactions**: Intervals of inactivity.

Such datasets pose difficulties for traditional statistical methods, which struggle to generate meaningful classifications due to the distortion caused by zeros.

### Objective

The goal of this paper is to propose a generalized framework for threshold classification in zero-inflated time series data. While precipitation data is the primary example, the method is adaptable to a wide range of other data types, providing valuable tools for various analytical domains.

## 2. Challenges in Classifying Zero-Inflated Data

### Case Study: Precipitation Data

Consider a time series dataset of hourly precipitation measurements. The task is to classify each observation into one of five intensity categories:

- **None**: No precipitation (0 mm/h).
- **Low**: Light precipitation.
- **Moderate**: Moderate precipitation.
- **Intense**: Heavy precipitation.
- **Severe**: Very heavy precipitation.

Attempts to define thresholds using standard methods such as percentiles and standard deviation intervals are problematic:

- **Percentiles**: Removing zeros before calculating percentiles narrows classification ranges, making the classification ineffective.
- **Mean and Standard Deviation**: Thresholds based on these metrics fail because zeros skew the mean and lead to invalid (negative) values.

### Limitations of Existing Methods

Common techniques for determining thresholds, such as quantiles and standard deviation intervals, assume data is normally distributed. Zero-inflated datasets violate these assumptions:

- **Percentile Methods**: Skewed by an excess of zeros, leading to uninformative or misleading threshold values.
- **Standard Deviation**: The combination of zero inflation and skewness results in thresholds that don't accurately reflect the underlying distribution.

## 3. Review of Threshold Classification and Zero-Inflated Models

### Threshold Classification Techniques

Threshold classification involves categorizing continuous data into discrete levels, such as light or heavy precipitation. Typical methods include:

- **Percentile-Based Thresholds**: Dividing data into quantiles.
- **Standard Deviation Intervals**: Defining intervals relative to the mean and standard deviation.

While effective for normal data, these methods fail with zero-inflated or skewed data distributions.

### Statistical Models for Zero-Inflated Data

Several statistical models have been developed for zero-inflated data, primarily in the context of count data:

- **Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) Models**: These handle count data with excess zeros by combining a Poisson distribution with a logit model for zero inflation.
- **Hurdle Models**: These models separately handle zeros and positive counts, making them flexible for certain applications.

Despite their utility in count data, these models are not well-suited for continuous time series data classification.

## 4. Proposed Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

#### Retaining Zero Values

Instead of excluding zeros, we retain them to preserve the dataset's true distribution. This approach recognizes zeros as meaningful events rather than noise.

#### Data Transformation

To reduce skewness, we apply transformations to the data, such as:

- **Log Transformation**: $\log(x + \epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is a small constant, to handle zeros.
- **Square Root Transformation**: Useful for stabilizing variance in count data.

The transformation used depends on the dataset's characteristics.

### Threshold Determination

#### Quantile-Based Classification with Zero Inflation

We calculate quantiles without removing zero values, ensuring that the classification captures the entire data distribution. This process involves:

1. Calculating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the data, including zeros.
2. Defining thresholds at specific quantiles (e.g., 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles).

#### Clustering Algorithms

We also explore clustering algorithms to define thresholds:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Suitable for evenly distributed data but struggles with skewness.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**: Useful for identifying clusters within skewed data by modeling it as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions.
- **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)**: Effective for detecting clusters in data with arbitrary shapes and varying densities.

#### Statistical Modeling

For highly skewed zero-inflated data, we use statistical models tailored to handle zero inflation, such as the **Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB)** model and **Hurdle Models**.

### Generalization Framework

Our proposed methodology is designed to be adaptable across various datasets and events. The framework includes:

1. **Data Characterization**: Understanding the proportion of zeros, skewness, and variance.
2. **Method Selection**: Choosing appropriate techniques based on data characteristics.
3. **Parameter Adjustment**: Customizing the model or algorithm parameters.
4. **Validation**: Evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.

## 5. Applications in Different Domains

### Precipitation Data

We apply the proposed methodology to precipitation data by retaining zero observations and applying a log transformation to mitigate skewness. The classification thresholds, derived from quantiles, are:

- **None**: 0 mm/h.
- **Low**: >0 to 25th percentile.
- **Moderate**: >25th to 50th percentile.
- **Intense**: >50th to 75th percentile.
- **Severe**: >75th percentile.

### Wind Speed

For wind speed data, which often includes periods of calm (zero readings), we use Gaussian Mixture Models to identify natural groupings. The method effectively distinguishes between calm, breezy, and windy conditions.

### Traffic Volume

Traffic flow data frequently features periods with no traffic. We apply DBSCAN to identify clusters corresponding to different traffic levels, defining thresholds based on cluster boundaries.

### Financial Transactions

Zero-inflated datasets are common in finance, where periods of inactivity (zero transactions) alternate with high transaction volumes. Hurdle models help in separating zero and positive transaction periods, allowing for meaningful classification of transaction intensity.

## 6. Evaluation and Validation

### Performance Metrics

We evaluate the performance of our methodology using the following metrics:

- **Classification Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified observations.
- **Precision and Recall**: Important when certain categories are rare but critical.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Helps identify misclassification patterns.

### Cross-Dataset Validation

To ensure the generalizability of the method, we apply it to different datasets, including:

- **Precipitation Data**: Datasets from diverse climatic regions.
- **Traffic Data**: Urban and rural traffic patterns.
- **Financial Data**: Periods of market volatility and stability.

### Comparison with Baseline Methods

We compare our approach with traditional percentile and standard deviation-based methods, showing that the proposed methodology yields more meaningful and accurate classifications.

## 7. Discussion

### Insights

The methodology effectively addresses challenges inherent to zero-inflated time series data:

- **Retention of Zero Values**: Recognizes zeros as meaningful rather than noise.
- **Adaptability**: Can be applied to a variety of datasets and event types.
- **Enhanced Classification**: More accurately reflects the data's true distribution.

### Limitations

- **Model Complexity**: Advanced techniques require computational resources and expertise.
- **Extremely Skewed Data**: Further adjustments may be needed for highly zero-inflated datasets.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper introduces a generalized methodology for threshold classification in zero-inflated time series data. The approach improves upon traditional methods by retaining zero values, applying appropriate transformations, and utilizing clustering and statistical models. This framework is adaptable to various domains, including meteorology, transportation, and finance, offering more accurate and generalizable classifications for event intensities.
