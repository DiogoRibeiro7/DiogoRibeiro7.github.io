title: Bayesian Inference Explained
---

Bayesian inference offers a powerful perspective on probability, treating unknown quantities as distributions that update when new evidence appears.

## Priors and Posteriors

The process begins with a **prior distribution** that captures our initial beliefs about a parameter. After observing data, we apply Bayes' theorem to obtain the **posterior distribution**, reflecting how our beliefs should change.

## Why Use Bayesian Methods?

Bayesian techniques are particularly useful when data is scarce or when incorporating domain knowledge is essential. They provide a coherent approach to uncertainty that can complement or outperform classical methods in many situations.
