Hypothesis testing allows data scientists to objectively assess whether an observed pattern is likely due to chance or reflects a genuine effect.

## Null vs. Alternative Hypotheses

Every test starts with a **null hypothesis**, representing the status quo, and an **alternative hypothesis**, representing a potential effect. By choosing a significance level and calculating a p-value, we can decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.

## Common Pitfalls

Misinterpreting p-values or failing to consider effect sizes can lead to misguided conclusions. Always pair statistical significance with domain context to ensure results are meaningful.
