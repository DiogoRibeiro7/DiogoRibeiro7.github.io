excerpt: Polynomial regression is a popular extension of linear regression that models
  nonlinear relationships between the response and explanatory variables. However,
  despite its name, polynomial regression remains a form of linear regression, as
  the response variable is still a linear combination of the regression coefficients.

  between the response and explanatory variables, is mathematically considered a form
  of linear regression.

summary: Polynomial regression models the relationship between the response variable
  and explanatory variables using a pth-order polynomial. Although this suggests a
  nonlinear relationship between the response and explanatory variables, it is still
  linear regression, as the linearity pertains to the relationship between the response
  variable and the regression coefficients.
