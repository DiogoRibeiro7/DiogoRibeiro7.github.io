NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2), for example, provides data on global CO2 levels with high accuracy.

- **Tracking deforestation and land use changes:** Satellites are able to capture changes in land cover, including deforestation, which is a major contributor to global carbon emissions. Programs like Landsat and Copernicus have been instrumental in providing high-resolution images of forests and monitoring deforestation activities in real-time. This information is used by governments and conservation organizations to track illegal logging and manage reforestation efforts.

- **Sea-level rise monitoring:** Satellites provide accurate measurements of global sea levels by monitoring the height of the ocean's surface. As climate change leads to melting glaciers and thermal expansion of seawater, satellite data is crucial for predicting the future impacts of rising sea levels on coastal communities.

### 2.2 Sensor Networks: Capturing Localized Climate Data

In addition to satellite data, ground-based sensor networks are an essential component of big data in climate science. These networks consist of a variety of sensors that measure environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and air quality at the local level. The ability to capture granular, real-time data from these sensors enhances the resolution of climate models and provides crucial insights into how climate change is affecting specific regions.

#### 2.2.1 Types of Sensors and Their Role in Climate Monitoring

- **Weather stations:** These are among the most common types of sensors used to monitor local weather conditions. They measure temperature, wind speed, humidity, and barometric pressure, providing detailed data that is essential for understanding short-term weather patterns and long-term climate trends.

- **Oceanographic sensors:** Deployed in oceans and coastal areas, these sensors monitor sea surface temperatures, salinity, ocean currents, and other variables that influence climate patterns. Networks like the Argo float system, consisting of thousands of drifting sensors, continuously collect data on the temperature and salinity of the upper layers of the ocean, which is crucial for tracking ocean warming and its effects on marine ecosystems.
