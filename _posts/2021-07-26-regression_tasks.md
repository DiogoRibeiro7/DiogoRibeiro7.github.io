When you work in a specific field long enough, certain lessons, concepts, and teachers leave a lasting impression. It's common to look back on these formative moments, especially when they spark a lifelong passion.

Take my mother, a teacher, for instance. She still remembers the substitute teacher who made her fall in love with philosophy. My Tae Kwon Do master, in a similar vein, fondly recalls the excitement of his first martial arts class as a child—an experience that shaped his career and love for Tae Kwon Do.

As for me, I’m a Machine Learning Engineer. The subject that I know best, and which has captured my professional enthusiasm, is machine learning. One moment that stands out is my first encounter with regression and classification during a lecture in my undergraduate studies. My professor made the difference between classification and regression crystal clear with examples. Classifying whether an email is spam or not is a typical classification task, whereas predicting the price of a house based on various features—like location or size—is a regression task.

In both classification and regression, we typically deal with a dataset represented by a matrix $X$ (input features), which has $n$ rows (data points) and $k$ columns (features). The output of our model is a vector $y$ with $n$ elements, corresponding to the rows in $X$. In classification, the values in $y$ are discrete labels (e.g., spam = 1, not spam = 0). In regression, the values are continuous, real numbers (e.g., house prices).

Regression tasks can be approached in many ways—perhaps too many. The rise of AI and the explosion of "ultimate solution" claims have made it hard to discern which method is best for a given dataset. The truth is that no single algorithm solves all problems. The best approach depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired outcome.

In this article, we’ll explore how to select the appropriate regression algorithm by considering:

- The linearity or polynomial nature of the dataset.
- The complexity of the dataset.
- The dimensionality of the input data.
- The need for probabilistic output.

For simplicity, we’ll focus on traditional machine learning methods, excluding neural networks, and work primarily with smaller, synthetic datasets.

Ready to dive in? Let’s explore the world of regression.

## 1. A Taxonomy of Regression Methods

To guide us through this, we can use a simple “rule of thumb” taxonomy to choose a suitable regression approach:

### Key Questions:
1. **Is the relationship between $X$ and $y$ linear or polynomial?**
   - **Yes**:
     - Is the number of features $k$ small?
       - **Yes**: Use Linear or Polynomial Regression.
       - **No**: Use Principal Component Regression.
   - **No**:
     - Is a probabilistic output needed?
       - **Yes**: Use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).
       - **No**: Use Support Vector Regression (SVR).

This taxonomy provides a foundation for navigating regression tasks. In the following sections, we’ll explore each of these methods in detail—both theoretically and with code examples.

## 2. Linear and Polynomial Regression

### 2.1 Explanation

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely known methods for regression tasks. It models the relationship between input features $X$ and the target $y$ as a linear function. Mathematically, we can express the model as:

$$
y = XW + w_0
$$

Where:
- $X$ is the input matrix of size $n \times k$,
- $W$ is the weights matrix (one weight for each feature),
- $w_0$ is the intercept term (bias).

Linear regression assumes that the output is a weighted sum of the input features. When we perform **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** regression, the weights are calculated by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values:

$$
W = (X^TX)^{-1} X^T y
$$

In polynomial regression, the principle is the same, but we transform the input matrix $X$ into a new matrix of polynomial features. For example, for a second-degree polynomial, the transformed matrix $X_\text{poly}$ contains columns for each feature raised to the powers of 1, 2, and possibly higher.

### 2.2 Code Example

Here’s how we can implement linear regression in Python using the popular library `scikit-learn`:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

# Simulate data
X = np.linspace(1, 20, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y = 3*X + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 5

# Fit linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Plot
plt.scatter(X, y, label='Data')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', label='Linear Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
