Real-world datasets rarely come perfectly formatted for modeling. A well-designed **data preprocessing pipeline** ensures that you apply the same transformations consistently across training and production environments.

## Handling Missing Values

Start by assessing the extent of missing data. Common strategies include dropping incomplete rows, filling numeric columns with the mean or median, and using the most frequent category for categorical features.

## Encoding Categorical Variables

Many machine learning algorithms require numeric inputs. Techniques like **one-hot encoding** or **ordinal encoding** convert categories into numbers. Scikit-learn's `ColumnTransformer` allows you to apply different encoders to different columns in a single pipeline.

## Scaling and Normalization

Scaling features to a common range prevents variables with large magnitudes from dominating a model. Standardization (mean of zero, unit variance) is typical for linear models, while min-max scaling keeps values between 0 and 1.

## Putting It All Together

Use scikit-learn's `Pipeline` to chain preprocessing steps with your model. This approach guarantees that the exact same transformations are applied when predicting on new data, reducing the risk of data leakage and improving reproducibility.
