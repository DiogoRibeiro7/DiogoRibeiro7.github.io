Probability distributions form the foundation of statistical modeling and machine learning, enabling the representation and analysis of uncertainty in data. These distributions provide a mathematical framework to describe how data points are spread, which is crucial for making inferences, predictions, and decisions in various applications. This document will explore key probability distributions used in machine learning, their properties, and their applications.

We will cover the following distributions:

1. Bernoulli Distribution
2. Multinoulli Distribution
3. Gaussian Distribution
4. Various Continuous Distributions (Exponential, Beta, etc.)

## Binary Outcomes - The Bernoulli Distribution

The Bernoulli distribution models binary outcomes, representing scenarios where there are only two possible outcomes: success (1) or failure (0). This distribution is essential in fields like medical diagnostics (e.g., presence or absence of a disease) and quality control (e.g., defective or non-defective products).

### Mathematical Formulation

The Bernoulli distribution is parameterized by a single parameter $$ p $$, which represents the probability of success:
$$ P(X=1) = p $$
$$ P(X=0) = 1 - p $$

The probability mass function (PMF) is given by:
$$ P(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x} \quad \text{for } x \in \{0, 1\} $$

### Properties

- Mean (Expected Value): $$ E[X] = p $$
- Variance: $$ \text{Var}(X) = p(1 - p) $$

### Real-World Example

Consider a coin toss where the probability of landing heads (success) is $$ p $$. If $$ p = 0.5 $$, the coin is fair; otherwise, it is biased.

## Categorical Data - The Multinoulli Distribution

The Multinoulli (or Categorical) distribution generalizes the Bernoulli distribution to scenarios with more than two possible outcomes. It is useful in natural language processing (e.g., predicting the next word in a sentence) and recommendation systems (e.g., suggesting one of many products).

### Mathematical Formulation

The Multinoulli distribution is parameterized by a vector $$ \mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k) $$ where $$ p_i $$ represents the probability of the $$ i $$-th category and $$ \sum_{i=1}^k p_i = 1 $$.

The probability mass function is:
$$ P(X=i) = p_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, k $$

### Properties

- Mean (Expected Value): $$ E[X_i] = p_i $$
- Variance: $$ \text{Var}(X_i) = p_i (1 - p_i) $$
- Covariance: $$ \text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = -p_i p_j \quad \text{for } i \ne j $$

### Real-World Example

In a survey with multiple choices, each choice corresponds to a category, and the probabilities $$ p_i $$ represent the likelihood of each choice being selected.

## The Ubiquitous Gaussian Distribution

The Gaussian (or Normal) distribution is perhaps the most widely used distribution in statistics and machine learning due to its properties and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables tends to follow a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.

### Mathematical Formulation

The Gaussian distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean $$ \mu $$ and the variance $$ \sigma^2 $$. Its probability density function (PDF) is:
$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left( -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) $$

### Properties

- Mean (Expected Value): $$ E[X] = \mu $$
- Variance: $$ \text{Var}(X) = \sigma^2 $$
- Symmetry: The Gaussian distribution is symmetric around its mean $$ \mu $$.

### Real-World Example

In finance, asset returns often follow a Gaussian distribution, facilitating portfolio optimization and risk management.

## Continuous Distributions and Their Applications

Beyond the Gaussian distribution, other continuous distributions are vital in various applications. We will discuss the Exponential, Beta, and other distributions.

### Exponential Distribution

The Exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process. It is characterized by a single parameter $$ \lambda $$ (rate parameter):
$$ f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \quad \text{for } x \ge 0 $$

#### Properties

- Mean (Expected Value): $$ E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda} $$
- Variance: $$ \text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} $$

#### Real-World Example

In health tech, the Exponential distribution models the time until failure of medical equipment.

### Beta Distribution

The Beta distribution is useful for modeling proportions and probabilities. It is characterized by two shape parameters, $$ \alpha $$ and $$ \beta $$:
$$ f(x; \alpha, \beta) = \frac{x^{\alpha-1} (1-x)^{\beta-1}}{B(\alpha, \beta)} \quad \text{for } 0 \le x \le 1 $$
where $$ B(\alpha, \beta) $$ is the Beta function.

#### Properties

- Mean (Expected Value): $$ E[X] = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} $$
- Variance: $$ \text{Var}(X) = \frac{\alpha \beta}{(\alpha + \beta)^2 (\alpha + \beta + 1)} $$

#### Real-World Example

In manufacturing, the Beta distribution models the proportion of defective items in a production batch.

Understanding probability distributions is crucial for effectively modeling, analyzing, and making predictions based on data in machine learning. The Bernoulli, Multinoulli, Gaussian, Exponential, and Beta distributions each play unique roles in handling different types of data and scenarios. By mastering these distributions, one can harness the power of statistical modeling to address a wide range of real-world problems.
