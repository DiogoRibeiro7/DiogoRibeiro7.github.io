title: Exploring Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNN) for Outlier Detection
---

In this article, we will delve into the concept of Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNN), a distance metric that has shown significant utility in various machine learning tasks, particularly in outlier detection and clustering. Traditional distance metrics like Euclidean and Manhattan distances often fail to capture meaningful similarities when working with high-dimensional datasets or data with variable densities. SNN provides a robust alternative in such situations.

We'll cover the origins of SNN in clustering algorithms like DBSCAN, explore its effectiveness in k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) outlier detection, and analyze how it compares to more common metrics. The implementation of SNN in Python will be presented in an appendix, making it easier to reproduce and experiment with the techniques discussed here.

This article assumes familiarity with basic distance-based algorithms like kNN, DBSCAN, and standard metrics like Euclidean and Manhattan distances. If these concepts are new to you, consider reviewing these topics before proceeding.

## The Importance of Distance Metrics in Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms that rely on distance calculations are ubiquitous in data science. Distance metrics are a foundational concept in several key tasks, including:

1. **Predictive Modeling:** Distance metrics are integral in models like k Nearest Neighbors (kNN). For classification tasks, kNN uses distance metrics to identify the k most similar records to the instance being classified. The majority class of these neighbors is then assigned as the prediction. For regression, the predicted value is typically the average of the target values of the k nearest neighbors.

2. **Clustering:** Distance metrics play a central role in clustering algorithms. Whether using centroid-based clustering (e.g., k-means), density-based clustering (e.g., DBSCAN), or hierarchical clustering, distance measures are used to group similar instances into clusters. The choice of metric significantly impacts the performance and accuracy of the clustering process.

3. **Outlier Detection:** Outlier detection algorithms frequently rely on distance calculations. Methods like k Nearest Neighbors outlier detection, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Local Outlier Probabilities (LoOP) utilize distance metrics to quantify how far a record is from its nearest neighbors. Records that are significantly farther from their neighbors than average are flagged as outliers.

### Why Standard Distance Metrics Fail in High-Dimensional Data

The **curse of dimensionality** is one of the most challenging problems in machine learning, especially when working with distance-based algorithms. As the number of dimensions increases, the distance between all points tends to converge, making it difficult to distinguish between truly similar and dissimilar records. This phenomenon manifests in several ways:

- **Equidistant Points:** As the number of dimensions grows, all points tend to become equidistant from one another, which weakens the discriminative power of distance metrics like Euclidean and Manhattan.
- **Irrelevant Features:** High-dimensional data often contains irrelevant or redundant features, which distort distance calculations by introducing noise. Distance metrics fail to account for the varying relevance of features in different contexts.
- **Dense vs. Sparse Regions:** Real-world data often has regions with variable density. For example, financial transactions may contain a large number of low-value sales and a few high-value transactions. In such datasets, standard distance metrics may misclassify instances from sparse regions as outliers, even if they are not unusual within their context.

### Addressing the Curse of Dimensionality with SNN

Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNN) is a distance metric designed to overcome some of the limitations of traditional metrics, especially in high-dimensional data with varying densities. SNN achieves this by emphasizing the concept of shared neighbors between points, rather than solely relying on direct distances.

The key innovation in SNN is that it assesses similarity between two points based on how many of their k nearest neighbors are shared. This shared-neighbor approach makes SNN more resilient to high-dimensional data, where the direct distances between points may be less informative.

In the next sections, we will explore how SNN was developed as an extension to the popular DBSCAN clustering algorithm, and how it can be used for outlier detection, where it excels in datasets with variable density.

## Origins of Shared Nearest Neighbors in Clustering

SNN was originally introduced as an enhancement to **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), a popular density-based clustering algorithm. DBSCAN is highly effective at identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes and is particularly well-suited to datasets with noise (outliers). However, DBSCAN struggles when clusters have varying densities. It assumes a global threshold for determining whether a point is part of a cluster, which can lead to poor results in datasets with dense and sparse regions.

### A Quick Overview of DBSCAN

To understand how SNN improves DBSCAN, let's briefly review how DBSCAN works. DBSCAN clusters data based on the following principles:

1. **Core Points:** A point is considered a core point if it has a sufficient number of neighbors within a specified distance (`eps`). These core points form the backbone of clusters.
2. **Directly Density-Reachable Points:** Points that are within `eps` distance from a core point are considered to be part of the same cluster.
3. **Noise Points:** Points that do not belong to any cluster are labeled as noise, or outliers.

DBSCAN is effective at clustering datasets where clusters have roughly uniform densities. However, when different clusters have different densities, DBSCAN's global `eps` threshold fails to distinguish between dense and sparse clusters.

### Enhancing DBSCAN with Shared Nearest Neighbors

Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNN) addresses the density problem in DBSCAN by refining how distances are measured. Instead of relying on the direct Euclidean or Manhattan distances between points, SNN considers the number of shared neighbors between two points. In essence, two points are considered similar if they share many of the same nearest neighbors, even if their raw distance is large.

This enhancement improves DBSCAN's ability to cluster data with varying densities. By shifting the focus from absolute distances to shared neighborhoods, SNN adapts more effectively to the local structure of the data.

Hereâ€™s a general process of how SNN works for clustering:

1. **Calculate Pairwise Distances:** Start by calculating the pairwise distances between all points using a traditional metric like Euclidean or Manhattan.
2. **Determine Nearest Neighbors:** For each point, find the k nearest neighbors based on the pairwise distances.
3. **Calculate Shared Nearest Neighbors:** For each pair of points, count how many of their k nearest neighbors are shared. The more neighbors they share, the closer they are considered to be.
4. **Cluster Formation (DBSCAN-like):** Once the shared-neighbor distances are calculated, clustering proceeds similarly to DBSCAN. Core points are identified, clusters are expanded, and noise points are labeled as outliers.

### The Jarvis-Patrick Clustering Algorithm

The concept of shared nearest neighbors is not entirely new. In fact, the earliest iteration of this idea can be traced back to the **Jarvis-Patrick Clustering Algorithm** (1973). This algorithm grouped points based on the number of shared neighbors, but it did not gain widespread popularity due to its computational cost. SNN builds on this foundational idea but introduces a more robust approach for modern applications, such as outlier detection and high-dimensional clustering.

In summary, while DBSCAN works well for uniform-density data, SNN shines in more complex datasets, making it a better option for clustering high-dimensional data or data with varying densities.

## Shared Nearest Neighbors in Outlier Detection

Outlier detection, or anomaly detection, is a crucial task in fields such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and network security. In such applications, identifying instances that deviate significantly from the norm can reveal critical insights or point to potential problems.

Many outlier detection algorithms, including k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), rely on distance metrics to evaluate how far a point is from its neighbors. The farther a point is from its neighbors, the more likely it is to be an outlier.

### Challenges in Outlier Detection

The primary challenge in outlier detection lies in accurately quantifying how "different" a point is from the rest of the data. Traditional methods, such as kNN outlier detection, compute the average or maximum distance between a point and its k nearest neighbors. However, this can be problematic in two key scenarios:

1. **High-Dimensional Data:** As mentioned earlier, distance metrics become less reliable as the number of dimensions increases. In high-dimensional spaces, distances between points tend to converge, making it difficult to distinguish between normal and anomalous points.
   
2. **Varying Densities:** In datasets with regions of varying density, traditional outlier detection methods often struggle. For example, in a financial dataset, the density of low-value transactions may be much higher than the density of high-value transactions. A traditional kNN outlier detector might incorrectly classify high-value transactions as outliers because their distances to neighbors are greater than those in the low-value region.

### How SNN Improves Outlier Detection

Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNN) offers a solution to these challenges by focusing on the local structure of the data rather than on absolute distances. Two points are considered similar not just because they are close in terms of raw distance, but because they share a similar neighborhood. In other words, the number of shared nearest neighbors between two points is a better indicator of their similarity than their direct distance.

#### SNN in kNN Outlier Detection

In the k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) outlier detection algorithm, each point's outlier score is typically the average distance to its k nearest neighbors. If a point is much farther from its neighbors than average, it is flagged as an outlier.

SNN modifies this approach by using shared neighbors as the distance metric. Instead of calculating the raw distance between a point and its neighbors, SNN computes the number of neighbors that the point shares with each of its k nearest neighbors. A point that shares few or no neighbors with its nearest neighbors is considered an outlier, even if its raw distance is not extreme.

This approach is especially useful in datasets with varying densities, where traditional distance-based methods tend to fail. In such datasets, SNN's focus on shared neighbors provides a more reliable indication of whether a point is truly an outlier.

For example, in a dataset of financial transactions, a high-value transaction may be distant from its neighbors in terms of raw dollar amount but may share many neighbors with them based on other features (e.g., the time of the transaction, the type of account involved). SNN would correctly classify this point as normal, while a traditional kNN outlier detector might misclassify it as an outlier.

### SNN and DBSCAN for Outlier Detection

SNN can also be integrated with density-based clustering algorithms like DBSCAN for outlier detection. DBSCAN naturally handles outliers (referred to as "noise points") by leaving them unclustered. However, DBSCAN's effectiveness depends on the choice of distance metric, which is typically Euclidean.

By using SNN distances instead of Euclidean distances, DBSCAN becomes more robust to high-dimensional data and varying densities. In SNN-DBSCAN, the outliers are points that have few or no shared neighbors with other points, and thus, are left unclustered.

This approach is particularly powerful in datasets where outliers are not just distant from the rest of the data but also reside in regions of low density. By focusing on shared neighbors, SNN-DBSCAN can identify outliers that might be missed by other methods.

## Advantages of SNN Over Traditional Distance Metrics

SNN offers several key advantages over traditional distance metrics like Euclidean and Manhattan distances, particularly in the context of outlier detection and clustering:

1. **Resilience to High Dimensionality:** In high-dimensional data, where traditional distance metrics break down due to the curse of dimensionality, SNN remains effective. By focusing on shared neighbors rather than direct distances, SNN provides a more robust measure of similarity between points.
   
2. **Adaptability to Varying Densities:** Traditional distance-based methods struggle with datasets that have regions of varying density. SNN, by contrast, adapts to local densities by focusing on shared neighborhoods. This makes it particularly well-suited to real-world datasets with uneven distributions.

3. **Improved Robustness in Noise Detection:** Outliers that are isolated from the rest of the data are more effectively identified by SNN-based methods because they have few or no shared neighbors with other points. This makes SNN especially useful in applications like fraud detection and network security.

4. **Flexibility Across Algorithms:** While SNN is most commonly associated with kNN outlier detection and DBSCAN clustering, it can be integrated into any algorithm that relies on distance metrics. This flexibility makes SNN a valuable tool for a wide range of machine learning tasks.

### Limitations of SNN

Despite its advantages, SNN is not without its limitations:

1. **Computational Complexity:** Calculating shared nearest neighbors is more computationally expensive than calculating raw distances. This makes SNN less suitable for very large datasets unless optimizations like approximate nearest neighbor search are employed.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity:** SNN relies on the choice of the parameter k (the number of nearest neighbors to consider). If k is set too low, the metric may not capture meaningful relationships between points. If k is set too high, the metric may lose its discriminative power, especially in datasets with a large number of irrelevant features.

3. **Mixed-Type Data:** SNN is primarily designed for numeric data. When working with datasets that contain categorical, date, or text features, SNN may not perform as well without appropriate preprocessing or feature engineering.

## Practical Implementation of SNN

In practice, implementing SNN involves two key steps:

1. **Calculate Pairwise Distances:** Use a traditional distance metric (e.g., Euclidean or Manhattan) to calculate the pairwise distances between points.
   
2. **Determine Shared Nearest Neighbors:** For each pair of points, count how many of their nearest neighbors are shared. This shared-neighbor count is used as the distance metric in subsequent calculations.

We will include detailed Python implementations of SNN-based outlier detection and SNN-enhanced DBSCAN in the appendix. These implementations can be used as a starting point for applying SNN to your own datasets.

## Appendix: Python Code for SNN Outlier Detection

Below is the Python code for implementing SNN-based outlier detection, along with an SNN-enhanced version of DBSCAN for clustering and outlier detection.

from sklearn.neighbors import BallTree
import statistics

class SNN:
    def __init__(self, metric='euclidean'):
        self.metric = metric

    def get_pairwise_distances(self, data, k):
        data = pd.DataFrame(data)
        balltree = BallTree(data, metric=self.metric)  
        knn = balltree.query(data, k=k+1)[1]
        pairwise_distances = np.zeros((len(data), len(data)))
        for i in range(len(data)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(data)):
                if (j in knn[i]) and (i in knn[j]):
                    weight = len(set(knn[i]).intersection(set(knn[j])))
                    pairwise_distances[i][j] = weight
                    pairwise_distances[j][i] = weight
        return pairwise_distances

    def fit_predict(self, data, k):
        data = pd.DataFrame(data)
        pairwise_distances = self.get_pairwise_distances(data, k)
        scores = [statistics.mean(sorted(x, reverse=True)[:k]) for x in pairwise_distances]
        min_score = min(scores)
        max_score = max(scores)
        scores = [min_score + (max_score - x) for x in scores]
        return scores
```

### SNN-Enhanced DBSCAN for Outlier Detection

```python
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

snn = SNN(metric='manhattan')
pairwise_dists = snn.get_pairwise_distances(df, k=100)

# Apply DBSCAN using precomputed SNN distances
clustering = DBSCAN(eps=975, min_samples=2, metric='precomputed').fit(pairwise_dists)
```

This code can be adapted to your specific needs and serves as a starting point for experimenting with SNN-based outlier detection and clustering.

Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNN) represents a powerful alternative to traditional distance metrics in machine learning, particularly for tasks like outlier detection and clustering. By focusing on shared neighbors rather than direct distances, SNN overcomes many of the challenges posed by high-dimensional data and varying densities.

While SNN may not always outperform simpler metrics like Euclidean or Manhattan distances, it is a robust tool that can be invaluable in certain scenarios. Its flexibility across multiple machine learning algorithms, combined with its adaptability to complex data structures, makes it a worthwhile addition to any data scientist's toolkit.

Whether you're dealing with fraud detection, anomaly detection in networks, or complex clustering tasks, experimenting with SNN could provide the extra edge needed to tackle difficult datasets.
