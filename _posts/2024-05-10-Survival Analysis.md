# Abstract

Survival analysis is a statistical method traditionally employed in medical research to analyze time-to-event data, such as the time until a patient’s recovery or death. Its utility has since expanded into the realm of management, where it serves as a robust tool for addressing various business-centric events that are measured over time. This analytical approach is particularly valuable in management for its ability to handle right-censored data—common in scenarios where customers leave a service or employees exit an organization before a study is concluded.

In management contexts, survival analysis facilitates the development of more sophisticated models for predicting customer churn, employee retention, and product longevity. These models help in making informed decisions that could significantly enhance managerial strategies and organizational policies. The article delves into several key applications of survival analysis, illustrating its potential through real-world examples in customer relationship management, human resources, and quality control.

Through these applications, survival analysis has demonstrated a unique capacity to uncover the hidden dynamics within time-to-event data, leading to insights that are often not accessible through more traditional statistical methods. The findings from applying survival analysis can guide strategic planning and operational improvements. Looking forward, the article identifies areas for future research, including the integration of survival analysis with machine learning techniques to further enhance predictive accuracy and operational efficiency in management practices. This synthesis promises to open new pathways for not only understanding but also forecasting critical events in various management domains.

# Introduction

Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that deals with the analysis of time until an event occurs, often referred to as "failure time analysis." This technique is vital for studying events through time, particularly when these events are not observed in all subjects due to end of study or other reasons, a scenario known as censoring. Initially developed for analyzing survival times in medical studies—like time to recovery from a disease or time to death—it has broadened its applications extensively over the years.

The historical roots of survival analysis can be traced back to the early 20th century, with its significant development during World War II when researchers were tasked with estimating the reliability of military equipment. The Kaplan-Meier estimator, developed in the 1950s, and the Cox proportional hazards model from the 1970s, are among the pivotal advancements in this field. These methodologies highlighted the importance of survival analysis in reliably estimating time-dependent phenomena without needing the full data, adapting well to the right-censored nature of many real-world datasets.

The crossover of survival analysis into management studies marks a significant expansion of its scope. In management, the techniques are adept at tackling various 'time-to-event' analyses, such as predicting when a customer will leave a service (customer churn), how long an employee will stay within a company (employee retention), or how long a product remains functional before it fails (product lifespan). This transition into management not only broadens the applicability of survival analysis but also enhances decision-making processes by providing deeper insights into operational and strategic dynamics within businesses. The adaptation of survival analytic methods in management underscores its growing importance across diverse disciplines, highlighting its capacity to inform and improve managerial decisions through precise, data-driven insights.
