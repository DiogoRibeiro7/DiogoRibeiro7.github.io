## Introduction

National statistical systems are integral to informed decision-making, providing essential data for policymakers, businesses, and international organizations. However, these systems are increasingly challenged by the need for high-quality, trustworthy data and the rapidly changing data landscape. Traditional methods of assessing statistical capacity are no longer sufficient to meet these evolving demands. In response, the World Bank has developed the Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI), a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate and enhance the statistical performance of countries globally.

The SPI offers a robust set of metrics that go beyond the limitations of the previous Statistical Capacity Index (SCI). By focusing on five key dimensions—data use, data services, data products, data sources, and data infrastructure—the SPI provides a nuanced view of a country's statistical capabilities. This new framework allows for a more detailed assessment, helping countries identify strengths and areas needing improvement.

This article explores the SPI dataset, which includes over 50 indicators for 186 countries from 2016 to 2022, with some data extending back to 2004. We will employ various statistical techniques and visualizations to analyze this rich dataset, offering insights into global statistical performance. The analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the data, providing actionable insights to enhance national statistical systems and support data-driven decision-making.
