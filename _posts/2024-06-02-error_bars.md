### Introduction

Today I would like to focus on the confusing reporting of findings using mean ± error bars. There is a very heterogeneous use of error bars in publications.

### Common Issues with Error Bars in Publications

- **Unlabeled Error Bars:** Some error bars are unlabeled, which occurs quite often, unfortunately, even in 2024. The articles with incomplete legends represent both the biological and physical sciences, across many different disciplines, and clearly should not be considered isolated examples.
- **Descriptive Use:** Some error bars are used in a descriptive manner, where the range shows the spread of the data and the standard deviation (SD) quantifies the variability in the data around the mean.
- **Inferential Use:** Some error bars are used for inferential purposes, such as classic standard error (SE), robust SE, and confidence intervals (CI).

### Why This Can Be Confusing

When reporting error bars in studies, several common errors can occur. These errors can mislead readers and obscure the true meaning of the data.

### Basic Rules for Reporting Error Bars

1. **Rule 1️⃣:** When showing error bars, always describe in the figure legends what they are.
2. **Rule 2️⃣:** The value of n (i.e., the sample size, or the number of independently performed experiments) must be stated in the figure legend.
3. **Rule 3️⃣:** Error bars and statistics should only be shown for independently repeated experiments (true replicated), and never for replicates.
4. **Rule 4️⃣:** Because experimental investigators are usually trying to compare experimental results with controls, it is usually appropriate to show inferential error bars, such as SE or CI, rather than SD. However, if n is very small (for example, n = 3), rather than showing error bars and statistics, it is better to simply plot the individual data points.

### Best Practices for Reporting Error Bars

In general, for inferential purposes, it is more appropriate to report CI than SE.

### Discussion

❓Are you always 100% certain of what error bars mean when you read reports/publications❓
❓If not, what is missing❓

"Error bars commonly appear in figures in publications, but experimental biologists are often unsure how they should be used and interpreted. In this article, we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars."

### Conclusion

Accurate and clear reporting of error bars is essential for the proper interpretation of study results. By following best practices and avoiding common errors, researchers can effectively communicate the variability and precision of their data, enhancing the transparency and reliability of their findings.
