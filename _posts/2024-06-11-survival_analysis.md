# Introduction

Survival analysis is a crucial statistical tool used to estimate the time until an event of interest occurs. This can be applied in various fields such as medical research, engineering, and customer analytics. This article explores the methods for estimating survival functions, focusing on parametric and non-parametric approaches.

# Parametric Survival Functions

## Assumptions and Basics

In parametric approaches, we assume that the survival function follows a specific shape. We start with the basic understanding that all subjects are alive at the beginning of the study (S(0) = 1), and the survival function decreases over time as subjects experience the event of interest.

## Exponential Survival Function

One commonly used parametric model is the exponential survival function:

\[ S(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \]

### Curve Fitting

The key task is to estimate the parameter Î» using the collected data points. This is typically done through curve fitting techniques.

## Other Parametric Models

Several other distributions can be used to model survival functions:

- **Weibull Distribution**
- **Gamma Distribution**
- **Log-Normal Distribution**
- **Log-Logistic Distribution**

Survival functions for these distributions are derived from their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), where:

\[ S(t) = 1 - \text{CDF}(t) \]

## Limitations

Parametric methods rely on the assumption that the chosen model fits the data well. If the data does not conform to the assumed model, the estimates can be inaccurate.

# Non-Parametric Survival Functions

## Kaplan-Meier Estimator

Non-parametric methods do not assume a specific shape for the survival function. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a popular non-parametric method that constructs a step function from the observed data:

\[ S(t) = \prod (1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i}) \]

where `d_i` is the number of events at time `t` and `n_i` is the number of individuals at risk just prior to time `t`.

## Advantages and Limitations

The Kaplan-Meier estimator is useful because it does not impose a structure on the data. However, it cannot extrapolate beyond the observed data points, which limits its predictive power.

# Machine Learning Approaches

Machine learning models can also be used to estimate survival functions, providing a flexible and powerful alternative to traditional statistical methods. These models can predict curves and handle complex patterns in the data without strict assumptions.

# Applications of Survival Analysis

## Beyond Medical Research

Survival analysis is not limited to medical studies. It is useful in scenarios involving incomplete data, known as right censoring. Common applications include:

- **Customer Churn Rate:** Estimating how long customers will continue using a service.
- **Product Return Rates:** Predicting the rate at which sold items are returned.
- **Lifetime Value of Shoppers:** Estimating the total value a customer will bring over time.

# Conclusion

Survival analysis offers powerful tools for dealing with incomplete data and predicting the time until events occur. By understanding both parametric and non-parametric methods, researchers and analysts can choose the best approach for their specific needs.
