# Abstract

Missing data are a common issue in clinical research, potentially leading to biased results and reduced statistical power if not properly addressed. Effective handling of missing data is critical for the validity and reliability of research findings. This article provides a comprehensive review of the mechanisms of missing data, including Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR), and Missing Not At Random (MNAR). It explores statistical methods for identifying the nature of missing data and discusses various approaches to handle missing data, with a particular emphasis on Multiple Imputation (MI) as the preferred method for MAR data. The article also addresses the limitations of traditional methods such as Complete Case Analysis (CCA) and Single Imputation, highlighting their potential to introduce bias. Through detailed guidelines and practical applications, this article aims to equip researchers with the necessary tools to manage missing data effectively, thereby enhancing the robustness and credibility of their clinical research outcomes.


## Introduction
