## Abstract
Missing data are a common issue in clinical research, potentially leading to biased results if not properly addressed. This article reviews the mechanisms of missing data, methods to explore and handle missing data, and provides guidelines for researchers to ensure the validity of their findings.

## Introduction
- Importance of handling missing data in clinical research.
- Overview of potential biases introduced by ignoring missing data.
- Aim of the article: To provide a comprehensive guide on identifying and dealing with missing data.

## Missing Data Mechanisms
### Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
- Definition and examples.
- Implications for data analysis.

### Missing at Random (MAR)
- Definition and examples.
- Strategies for handling MAR data.

### Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
- Definition and examples.
- Challenges in addressing MNAR data.

## Exploring Missing Data
### Statistical Tests for MCAR
- T-tests.
- Logistic regression analyses.

### Littleâ€™s MCAR Test
- Explanation and application.

### Distinguishing MAR from MNAR
- Inherent challenges and limitations.
- Importance of sensitivity analyses.

## Methods to Deal with Missing Data
### Complete Case Analysis (CCA)
- Description and limitations.
- Appropriate situations for CCA.

### Single Imputation Methods
- Mean imputation, regression imputation, last observation carried forward.
- Drawbacks and why these methods are not recommended.

### Multiple Imputation (MI)
- Overview and benefits of MI.
- Phases of MI: Imputation, analysis, and pooling.
- Recommended imputation techniques (e.g., predictive mean matching).

## Guidelines for Imputation
- Importance of a well-specified imputation model.
- Inclusion of outcome variables in the imputation model.
- Handling situations with high percentages of missing data.

## Case Studies and Practical Applications
- Examples of successful MI application in clinical research.
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

## Future Directions and Ongoing Research
- Current trends in MI research.
- Potential areas for further development.

## Conclusion
- Summary of key points.
- Final recommendations for researchers on handling missing data.

## References
- Comprehensive list of references cited throughout the article.
