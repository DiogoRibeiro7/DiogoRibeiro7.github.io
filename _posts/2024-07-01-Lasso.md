## Introduction

In statistical modeling and machine learning, regression methods play a crucial role in understanding relationships between variables and making predictions. One powerful technique that has gained significant attention is LASSO, which stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. LASSO is a type of linear regression that not only aims to improve prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of the model by enforcing sparsity in the coefficients.

The importance of regression methods in statistical modeling cannot be overstated. They are essential tools for data scientists and researchers to make informed decisions, understand underlying patterns, and predict future outcomes. Traditional regression methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) often struggle with high-dimensional data and multicollinearity, leading to overfitting and complex models that are hard to interpret.

LASSO addresses these challenges by incorporating both variable selection and regularization into the regression process. This results in simpler models that are more generalizable to new data. By setting some coefficients to zero, LASSO effectively selects a subset of relevant features, making the model easier to understand and interpret.

This article will delve into the details of LASSO regression, exploring its mathematical formulation, key features, and advantages over other methods. We will also discuss when to use LASSO, its practical applications, and the scenarios where it might not be the best choice. Finally, we will look at alternatives to LASSO, such as Elastic Net, which addresses some of its limitations.

The structure of the article is as follows:
