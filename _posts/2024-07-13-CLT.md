# Central Limit Theorems: A Comprehensive Overview

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the cornerstone results in probability theory and statistics. It provides a foundational understanding of how the distribution of sums of random variables behaves. This article explores various forms of the Central Limit Theorem, including the Lindeberg–Lévy, Lyapunov, Lindeberg–Feller, Orey's CLT, and Prokhorov's Theorem.

## Lindeberg–Lévy Central Limit Theorem

The Lindeberg–Lévy Central Limit Theorem is the most fundamental form of the CLT. It states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, each with a finite mean and variance, will be approximately normally distributed. This remarkable result holds regardless of the original distribution of the variables.

Mathematically, let \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) be i.i.d. random variables with mean \( \mu \) and variance \( \sigma^2 \). Define the normalized sum \( S_n \) as:

$$ S_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n X_i - n\mu \right) $$

As \( n \) approaches infinity, \( S_n \) converges in distribution to a standard normal variable \( N(0,1) \):

$$ S_n \xrightarrow{d} N(0,1) $$

This theorem forms the basis for many statistical methods and the understanding of sampling distributions.

## Lyapunov Central Limit Theorem

The Lyapunov CLT extends the classical CLT to situations where the random variables are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. This extension introduces the Lyapunov condition, which ensures the convergence to a normal distribution under more general circumstances.

For independent random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) with means \( \mu_i \) and variances \( \sigma_i^2 \), the Lyapunov condition requires:

$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{s_n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E} \left[ |X_i - \mu_i|^3 \right] = 0 $$

where \( s_n^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2 \). Under this condition, the normalized sum converges to a normal distribution:

$$ \frac{1}{s_n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i) \right) \xrightarrow{d} N(0,1) $$

## Lindeberg–Feller Central Limit Theorem

The Lindeberg–Feller CLT further generalizes the CLT by replacing the Lyapunov condition with the less restrictive Lindeberg condition. This theorem applies to sequences of independent random variables and offers a broader applicability.

The Lindeberg condition states that for any \( \epsilon > 0 \):

$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{s_n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E} \left[ (X_i - \mu_i)^2 \mathbf{1}_{\{|X_i - \mu_i| > \epsilon s_n\}} \right] = 0 $$

When this condition is satisfied, the sum of the normalized variables converges in distribution to a normal distribution.

## Orey's Central Limit Theorem

Orey's Central Limit Theorem generalizes the CLT to finite range dependent random variables. Unlike previous theorems that focus on independent variables, Orey's CLT accommodates certain dependencies among the variables.

In this context, random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) are said to have a finite range of dependence if there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( X_i \) is independent of \( X_j \) for \( |i - j| > k \). Under appropriate normalization, the sum of such variables converges to a normal distribution.

## Prokhorov's Theorem

Prokhorov's Theorem provides a further generalization by imposing conditions of tightness, leading to weak convergence of probability measures. This theorem broadens the applicability of the CLT to more abstract settings and is a powerful tool in probability theory.

Prokhorov's Theorem states that a sequence of probability measures \( \{ \mu_n \} \) on a metric space converges weakly to a probability measure \( \mu \) if and only if the sequence is tight and every subsequence has a further subsequence that converges weakly to \( \mu \).

## Other Versions of the Central Limit Theorem

Beyond these major theorems, there are other notable versions of the CLT, such as the Multivariate CLT and the Functional Central Limit Theorem. Each of these theorems provides distributional convergence guarantees under specific conditions, expanding the scope and utility of the Central Limit Theorem in various applications.

The Multivariate CLT extends the convergence to normality to vector-valued random variables, while the Functional CLT, also known as Donsker's Theorem, deals with convergence in the space of functions, often applied in stochastic processes.

In summary, the Central Limit Theorem and its various extensions form a critical part of probability theory, offering profound insights into the behavior of sums of random variables and their convergence to the normal distribution under a wide range of conditions.
