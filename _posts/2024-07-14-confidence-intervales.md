Statistical estimates always have some uncertainty. Consider a simple example of modeling house prices based solely on their area using linear regression. A prediction from this model wouldnâ€™t reveal the exact value of a house based on its area, because different houses of the same size can have different prices. Instead, the model predicts the mean value related to the outcome for a particular input.

The key point is that there's always some uncertainty involved in statistical estimates, and it is important to communicate this uncertainty. In this specific case, there are two types of uncertainties:
1. The uncertainty in estimating the true mean value.
2. The uncertainty in estimating the true value.

Confidence intervals and prediction intervals help us capture these uncertainties.

## Uncertainty in Estimating the True Mean Value

When we use a linear regression model to predict house prices based on area, we are essentially estimating the mean price for a given area. The uncertainty in this estimation arises because our model is based on a sample of data, not the entire population. This type of uncertainty is quantified using confidence intervals.

### Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval gives a range of values that is likely to contain the true mean value of the dependent variable (house price) for a given value of the independent variable (house area). It reflects the precision of our estimate of the mean. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many samples and build a confidence interval from each of them, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean value.

Mathematically, the confidence interval for the mean $\hat{y}$ at a given $x$ is given by:

\[ \hat{y} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-2} \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{y}) \]

where:
- $\hat{y}$ is the predicted mean value.
- $t_{\alpha/2, n-2}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution.
- $\text{SE}(\hat{y})$ is the standard error of the predicted mean.

## Uncertainty in Estimating the True Value

The true value of a single observation (house price) for a given area also has uncertainty, which is generally larger than the uncertainty in estimating the mean. This type of uncertainty is captured by prediction intervals.

### Prediction Intervals

A prediction interval gives a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the dependent variable for a single new observation, given a specific value of the independent variable. It accounts for both the variability in estimating the mean and the variability of individual observations around the mean. A 95% prediction interval means that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains the true value for a single new observation.

Mathematically, the prediction interval for a new observation $y_{\text{new}}$ at a given $x$ is given by:

\[ \hat{y} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-2} \cdot \sqrt{\text{SE}(\hat{y})^2 + \sigma^2} \]

where:
- $\hat{y}$ is the predicted mean value.
- $t_{\alpha/2, n-2}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution.
- $\text{SE}(\hat{y})$ is the standard error of the predicted mean.
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the residuals (the variability of observations around the mean).

## Conclusion

Understanding and communicating the uncertainties in statistical estimates is crucial. Confidence intervals and prediction intervals provide a structured way to quantify and convey these uncertainties. While confidence intervals help us understand the precision of our estimate of the mean, prediction intervals give us an idea of the range within which we can expect individual observations to fall. Both are essential tools for effective statistical analysis and interpretation.
