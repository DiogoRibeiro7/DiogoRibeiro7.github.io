Statistical estimates always have some uncertainty. Consider a simple example of modeling house prices based solely on their area using linear regression. A prediction from this model wouldn’t reveal the exact value of a house based on its area, because different houses of the same size can have different prices. Instead, the model predicts the mean value related to the outcome for a particular input.

The key point is that there's always some uncertainty involved in statistical estimates, and it is important to communicate this uncertainty. In this specific case, there are two types of uncertainties:

1. The uncertainty in estimating the true mean value.
2. The uncertainty in estimating the true value.

Confidence intervals and prediction intervals help us capture these uncertainties.

Understanding the nature of these uncertainties is crucial for making informed decisions based on statistical models. When we talk about the uncertainty in estimating the true mean value, we are referring to the fact that our model's prediction is an estimate of the average house price for a given area. This estimate is based on the data we have, but since our data is just a sample of the entire population of houses, there is a margin of error associated with this estimate. This is where confidence intervals come into play. A confidence interval gives us a range within which we believe the true mean value lies, with a certain level of confidence (usually 95%).

On the other hand, the uncertainty in estimating the true value for an individual house price is captured by prediction intervals. Even if we knew the exact mean price for houses of a particular area, individual houses can still vary significantly around this mean due to various factors not included in our model, such as location, condition, and market trends. A prediction interval provides a range within which we expect the price of an individual house to lie, again with a specified level of confidence.

By clearly distinguishing between these two types of uncertainty, we can better understand the limitations of our model and the reliability of its predictions. This understanding helps in setting realistic expectations and making better decisions. For instance, when buying a house, knowing that a predicted price comes with a certain degree of uncertainty can inform negotiations and risk assessments.

In practice, effectively communicating these uncertainties involves presenting confidence and prediction intervals alongside point estimates. This approach ensures that stakeholders have a more complete picture of what the model's predictions actually mean, fostering more accurate interpretations and more informed decision-making.

## Uncertainty in Estimating the True Mean Value

When we use a linear regression model to predict house prices based on area, we are essentially estimating the mean price for a given area. The uncertainty in this estimation arises because our model is based on a sample of data, not the entire population. This type of uncertainty is quantified using confidence intervals.

Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which we expect the true mean price to lie, with a certain level of confidence. For instance, a 95% confidence interval suggests that if we were to repeat our sampling process and re-estimate the mean price multiple times, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean price. This interval accounts for the sampling variability, acknowledging that different samples can yield different estimates of the mean.

Mathematically, the confidence interval for the mean $\mu$ can be expressed as:

$$
\bar{y} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

where:

- $\bar{y}$ is the sample mean,
- $t_{\alpha/2, n-1}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom,
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation,
- $n$ is the sample size.

This formula adjusts the sample mean by a margin of error that reflects the variability of the data and the size of the sample. Larger samples tend to yield more precise estimates (narrower confidence intervals), whereas smaller samples result in wider intervals due to higher uncertainty.

In the context of house prices, consider that we have a dataset of house prices for different areas. Our linear regression model uses this data to estimate the mean price for a house of a certain size. However, since this dataset is just a sample, our estimate of the mean price is not exact. The confidence interval gives us a plausible range for the mean price, allowing us to understand the degree of uncertainty associated with our estimate.

By reporting confidence intervals alongside point estimates, we provide a more complete and transparent picture of the uncertainty inherent in our predictions. This practice enhances the reliability of the information communicated to stakeholders, ensuring that they understand the potential variability in the estimated mean house prices.

### Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval gives a range of values that is likely to contain the true mean value of the dependent variable (house price) for a given value of the independent variable (house area). It reflects the precision of our estimate of the mean. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many samples and build a confidence interval from each of them, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean value.

Mathematically, the confidence interval for the mean $\hat{y}$ at a given $x$ is given by:

$$
\hat{y} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-2} \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{y})
$$

where:

- $\hat{y}$ is the predicted mean value.
- $t_{\alpha/2, n-2}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.
- $\text{SE}(\hat{y})$ is the standard error of the predicted mean.

The standard error of the predicted mean, $\text{SE}(\hat{y})$, quantifies the variability of the prediction due to sampling variability. It can be calculated as:

$$
\text{SE}(\hat{y}) = s \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x - \bar{x})^2}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}}
$$

where:

- $s$ is the sample standard deviation of the residuals.
- $n$ is the sample size.
- $x$ is the value of the independent variable for which the prediction is made.
- $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the independent variable values.
- $x_i$ represents each value of the independent variable in the sample.

This formula takes into account both the sample size and the spread of the independent variable values around their mean. Larger sample sizes and less variability in $x$ lead to smaller standard errors, resulting in narrower confidence intervals and more precise estimates of the mean.

For example, if our linear regression model predicts that the mean price of a house with a certain area is $\$300,000$, and the 95% confidence interval is $\$290,000$ to $\$310,000$, this means we are 95% confident that the true mean price for houses of that size falls within this range. This interval helps communicate the uncertainty and precision of our estimate, providing valuable context for interpreting the model's predictions.

Confidence intervals are a crucial tool in statistical modeling, allowing us to quantify and communicate the uncertainty in our estimates of the mean. By presenting confidence intervals alongside point estimates, we can provide a more accurate and transparent picture of the model's reliability.

## Uncertainty in Estimating the True Value

The true value of a single observation (house price) for a given area also has uncertainty, which is generally larger than the uncertainty in estimating the mean. This type of uncertainty is captured by prediction intervals.

### Prediction Intervals

A prediction interval gives a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the dependent variable for a single new observation, given a specific value of the independent variable. It accounts for both the variability in estimating the mean and the variability of individual observations around the mean. A 95% prediction interval means that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains the true value for a single new observation.

Mathematically, the prediction interval for a new observation $y_{\text{new}}$ at a given $x$ is given by:

$$ 
\hat{y} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-2} \cdot \sqrt{\text{SE}(\hat{y})^2 + \sigma^2} 
$$

where:

- $\hat{y}$ is the predicted mean value.
- $t_{\alpha/2, n-2}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution.
- $\text{SE}(\hat{y})$ is the standard error of the predicted mean.
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the residuals (the variability of observations around the mean).

The standard error of the predicted mean, $\text{SE}(\hat{y})$, and the variance of the residuals, $\sigma^2$, together capture the total uncertainty in predicting a new observation. The standard error accounts for the uncertainty in estimating the mean, while the residual variance reflects the inherent variability in house prices that the model does not explain.

To calculate the prediction interval, we combine these two sources of variability. This results in a wider interval than the confidence interval for the mean, reflecting the additional uncertainty in predicting individual outcomes.

For example, if our linear regression model predicts that the mean price of a house with a certain area is \$300,000, the 95% confidence interval might be \$290,000 to \$310,000. However, the 95% prediction interval could be \$270,000 to \$330,000, accounting for the larger uncertainty in predicting the price of a single house. This broader range reflects the natural variability in house prices, such as differences in location, condition, and market conditions, which are not captured by the model.

By presenting prediction intervals, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty involved in individual predictions. This is particularly useful for practical applications, such as when a buyer or seller wants to know the likely range of prices for a specific house, rather than just the average price for similar houses.

In summary, prediction intervals are a valuable tool in statistical modeling, allowing us to quantify and communicate the uncertainty in predicting individual outcomes. By using prediction intervals alongside confidence intervals, we can offer a clearer and more informative picture of the reliability and variability of our model's predictions.

## Conclusion

Understanding and communicating the uncertainties in statistical estimates is crucial. Confidence intervals and prediction intervals provide a structured way to quantify and convey these uncertainties. While confidence intervals help us understand the precision of our estimate of the mean, prediction intervals give us an idea of the range within which we can expect individual observations to fall. Both are essential tools for effective statistical analysis and interpretation.
