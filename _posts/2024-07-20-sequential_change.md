title: Sequential Detection of Switches in Models with Changing Structures
---

Sequential detection of structural changes in models is a critical aspect in various domains, enabling timely and informed decision-making. This involves identifying moments when the parameters or structure of a model change, often signaling significant events or shifts in the underlying data-generating process.

## Key Concepts

**Model Change Points**: These are specific moments when the model's characteristics alter. For example, in a financial context, a change point might correspond to a sudden market crash, signifying a shift in market dynamics. Detecting these points helps understand new conditions and adapt accordingly.

**Sequential Detection**: This refers to the ongoing monitoring of incoming data to detect changes as they occur. Unlike retrospective analysis, sequential detection allows real-time identification of structural changes, essential for prompt action in dynamic environments.

**Statistical Methods**: Techniques such as hypothesis testing and likelihood ratios are used to statistically determine whether a change has occurred. These methods provide a formal framework for evaluating the presence of change points.

**Real-time Processing**: The capability to analyze data in real-time is vital for applications where immediate decision-making is crucial. Real-time processing ensures that changes are detected as soon as they occur, allowing for rapid responses.

## Methods for Change Detection

### Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) Control Chart

**Concept**: CUSUM monitors change detection by accumulating the sum of deviations from a target value, effective for detecting shifts in the mean level of a process.

**Application**: Commonly used in quality control to identify deviations in manufacturing processes, ensuring consistent product quality.

### Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR)

**Concept**: GLR compares the likelihood of data under different models to detect changes in statistical properties. This method is versatile and applicable to various types of data and models.

**Application**: Widely used in signal processing and communications to detect shifts in signal characteristics, enhancing system performance and reliability.

### Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

**Concept**: HMMs model systems with unobserved (hidden) states, estimating the likelihood of transitions between states. This makes them powerful for detecting structural changes in systems with underlying state dynamics.

**Application**: Extensively used in speech recognition, bioinformatics, and financial modeling to identify underlying state changes that are not directly observable.

### Bayesian Change Point Detection

**Concept**: This approach uses Bayesian inference to update the probability of a change point as new data is observed. It provides a probabilistic framework for detecting changes, incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainties.

**Application**: Used in various fields, including environmental monitoring and clinical trials, where incorporating prior information and dealing with uncertainties is crucial.

## Example: Python Implementation for CUSUM

To illustrate change detection using CUSUM, consider the following Python example for detecting a mean shift in time series data.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def cusum(data: np.ndarray, threshold: float, drift: float = 0) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    CUSUM algorithm for detecting mean shifts in data.
    
    Parameters:
    - data: np.ndarray, the input data series.
    - threshold: float, the decision threshold.
    - drift: float, the allowable drift (default is 0).
    
    Returns:
    - np.ndarray, points where change is detected.
    """
    n = len(data)
    cusum_pos = np.zeros(n)
    cusum_neg = np.zeros(n)
    
    change_points = []
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        cusum_pos[i] = max(0, cusum_pos[i-1] + data[i] - drift)
        cusum_neg[i] = min(0, cusum_neg[i-1] + data[i] + drift)
        
        if cusum_pos[i] > threshold:
            change_points.append(i)
            cusum_pos[i] = 0  # reset after detecting change
        elif cusum_neg[i] < -threshold:
            change_points.append(i)
            cusum_neg[i] = 0  # reset after detecting change
    
    return np.array(change_points)

# Example usage:
np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
data[500:] += 5  # Introduce a shift in the mean

threshold = 5
change_points = cusum(data, threshold)

plt.plot(data, label='Data')
plt.axvline(x=500, color='r', linestyle='--', label='True Change Point')
plt.scatter(change_points, data[change_points], color='g', label='Detected Change Points')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Application Areas

### Finance

**Example**: Detecting regime changes in stock prices or volatility can signal economic shifts or market trends, such as a sudden increase in volatility indicating a financial crisis.

**Benefit**: Early detection allows investors and analysts to adjust strategies, minimizing risks and maximizing returns.

### Manufacturing

**Example**: Monitoring process quality to detect equipment malfunctions can prevent costly downtime and maintain product quality, such as identifying a calibration issue with equipment.

**Benefit**: Prompt identification of changes ensures consistent product quality and avoids defects.

### Biology

**Example**: Identifying changes in gene expression or physiological signals provides insights into biological processes or disease progression, such as detecting the onset of a disease.

**Benefit**: Early detection leads to timely medical interventions and a better understanding of disease mechanisms.

### Climate Science

**Example**: Detecting shifts in climate patterns helps understand and predict climate change impacts, such as a significant change in temperature trends indicating a shift in climate regimes.

**Benefit**: Understanding these shifts informs policy decisions and strategies for mitigating climate change effects.

By applying these methods, analysts can identify significant structural changes in data streams, allowing for timely responses and a better understanding of underlying processes. This approach is essential for making informed decisions in dynamic environments, where changes can have substantial impacts.
