title: 'Understanding Drift in Machine Learning: Causes, Types, and Solutions'
---

Machine learning models are trained with historical data, but once they are used in the real world, they may become outdated and lose their accuracy over time due to a phenomenon called drift. Drift is the change over time in the statistical properties of the data that was used to train a machine learning model. This can cause the model to become less accurate or perform differently than it was designed to. This series of articles will deep dive into why model drift happens, different types of drift, algorithms to detect them, and finally, wrap up with an open-source implementation of drift detection in Python.

## Understanding Drift in Machine Learning

### Causes of Model Drift

Drift in machine learning can occur for several reasons, such as:

- **Changes in the distribution of input data over time:** This can happen when the underlying data generation process changes.
- **Changes in the relationship between input (x) and target (y):** This can be due to evolving external factors affecting the target variable.

These changes can significantly impact a model's performance, making it less reliable and accurate.

### Types of Drift

Model drift can take several forms, each with unique characteristics and implications:

1. **Feature Drift**
2. **Label Drift**
3. **Concept Drift**
4. **Prediction Drift**
5. **Reality Drift**
6. **Feedback Drift**

Each type of drift affects the model differently and requires specific monitoring and mitigation strategies.

## Feature Drift

Feature drift occurs when the statistical properties of the input features change. For example, if an ice cream propensity-to-buy model uses weather forecast data, an unexpected change in the weather data format or scale can lead to feature drift. This can significantly degrade the model's performance, as illustrated in Figure 1 below.

**Figure 1. Feature drift due to numeric scaling changes**

To detect and address feature drift:

- Implement feature monitoring that tracks the mean and standard deviation.
- Use heuristic control logic to catch significant deviations.

## Label Drift

Label drift is caused by shifts in the distribution of the target variable. This drift can be challenging to detect because it may appear as improved model performance while causing significant business impacts.

**Figure 2. Label drift in prediction distribution**

Key strategies for detecting label drift include:

- Monitoring the ratio of label predictions over time.
- Using statistical tests like Fisher's exact test to compare recent and validation metrics.

## Concept Drift

Concept drift happens when the relationship between input features and the target variable changes due to unobserved external factors. This can lead to significant shifts in model predictions and business metrics.

**Figure 3. Concept drift effects on model performance and business impact**

Monitoring for concept drift involves:

- Logging primary model error metrics and model attribution criteria.
- Evaluating trends in aggregated prediction statistics.

## Prediction Drift

Prediction drift is similar to label drift but relates to changes in the model's predictions due to shifts in the features used by the model. For example, a model might start issuing too many coupons in a new region, causing stock issues.

**Figure 4. Prediction drift leading to stock issues**

To detect prediction drift:

- Monitor the distribution of feature priors compared to recent values.
- Use statistical process control (SPC) rules to detect deviations.

## Reality Drift

Reality drift is a special case of concept drift caused by significant external events, such as a global pandemic, that fundamentally alter the data landscape. These events can render models obsolete, necessitating either abandonment or extensive retraining.

**Figure 5. Impact of reality drift on model performance**

Addressing reality drift requires:

- Conducting a comprehensive assessment of model features.
- Rebuilding models with new data reflecting the changed reality.

## Feedback Drift and the Law of Diminishing Returns

Feedback drift occurs when the model's predictions influence the future input data, creating a feedback loop that can degrade model performance over time. This is common in scenarios like churn models and recommendation engines.

To mitigate feedback drift:

- Regularly evaluate the prediction quality and retrain models with new data.
- Track metrics using tools like MLflow Tracking.

## Consequences of Model Drift

Understanding the potential consequences of model drift is crucial:

- **Decreased Accuracy and Reliability:** Drift can lead to less accurate predictions.
- **Biased and Unfair Outputs:** Outdated concepts can introduce biases.
- **Degraded Decision-Making:** Drift can result in poor decision-making.
- **Loss of Trust and Reputation:** Consistent inaccuracies can erode user trust.

By understanding these potential consequences, it becomes evident why proactively monitoring and mitigating model drift is crucial for maintaining the effectiveness and reliability of machine learning systems.

## Conclusion

Model drift is an inevitable challenge in deploying machine learning models in dynamic real-world environments. Understanding the different types of drift, their causes, and the strategies for detection and mitigation is essential for maintaining model performance and ensuring reliable predictions.

In part II of this series, we will focus on corrective actions for different types of drifts and present practical examples with Python code and open-source tools.
