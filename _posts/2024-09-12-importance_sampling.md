**Abstract**

Estimating credit risk in portfolios containing loans or bonds is crucial for financial institutions. Monte Carlo simulation, the traditional method for calculating credit risk, is often computationally expensive due to the low probability of defaults, especially for highly rated entities. Importance Sampling (IS) offers a more efficient alternative by focusing simulations on scenarios that lead to rare but significant losses. This article explains the implementation of IS in a portfolio credit risk context, particularly within the normal copula model. We delve into IS theory, its practical application, and the numerical examples that support its effectiveness in improving simulation performance.

## Importance Sampling (IS) for Credit Risk

### Overview of Importance Sampling

Importance Sampling (IS) is a **variance reduction technique** used to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations. The goal is to modify the sampling process to focus on events that contribute significantly to the rare-event probabilities, such as large losses in a credit portfolio.

In a basic Monte Carlo simulation, each scenario is drawn randomly based on the real-world probability distribution. In contrast, **Importance Sampling** changes the probability distribution from which scenarios are drawn, making extreme events (like multiple defaults) more likely in the simulation.

Once the events are sampled from this modified distribution, a **weighting adjustment** is applied to correct for the altered distribution, ensuring the simulation remains unbiased. This weighting is calculated using the **likelihood ratio** of the original and modified distributions.

### The Challenge of Dependence Between Defaults

A critical challenge in applying IS to credit risk is the **dependence structure** between obligors in a portfolio. Dependence can be modeled using **copulas**, which link individual default probabilities to shared risk factors. One widely used copula in credit risk is the **normal copula model**.

In this model, each obligorâ€™s default is influenced by a set of **systematic factors** (e.g., industry or geographic risk), making it harder to apply IS effectively. The difficulty lies in determining how to modify both the default probabilities and the distribution of these underlying factors.

## Implementing Importance Sampling in Credit Risk

### Importance Sampling for Independent Obligors

The simplest case of IS involves **independent obligors**. Here, defaults occur without any dependence on common factors, and IS can be applied by **exponentially twisting** the default probabilities. This means adjusting the probabilities to make defaults more likely during simulation.

For each obligor $$ k $$, the default probability is altered using a twisting parameter $$ \theta $$:

$$
p_{k,\theta} = \frac{p_k e^{\theta c_k}}{1 + p_k(e^{\theta c_k} - 1)}
$$

The likelihood ratio used to correct the distribution becomes:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{m} \left( \frac{p_k}{p_{k,\theta}} \right)^{Y_k} \left( \frac{1 - p_k}{1 - p_{k,\theta}} \right)^{1 - Y_k}
$$

By optimizing $$ \theta $$ to minimize the variance of the estimator, we significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation.

### Conditional Importance Sampling for Dependent Obligors

When obligors are dependent (i.e., influenced by common risk factors), IS becomes more complex. The IS process is divided into two steps:

1. **Conditional IS**: First, we apply IS **conditionally** on the systematic factors $$ Z $$. Given these factors, the defaults of individual obligors become conditionally independent, and we can apply the same exponential twisting method as in the independent case.

2. **Shifting the Factor Distribution**: To improve the effectiveness of IS when defaults are highly correlated, we also apply IS to the distribution of the **factors** $$ Z $$. By shifting the mean of the systematic factors, we increase the likelihood of scenarios that lead to large portfolio losses.
