ARIMA models remain a cornerstone of classical time series analysis. Python's `statsmodels` package makes it straightforward to specify, fit, and evaluate these models.

## 1. Identifying the ARIMA Order

Plot the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) to determine suitable values for the AR (p) and MA (q) terms. Differencing can help stabilize non-stationary series before fitting.

## 2. Fitting the Model

With parameters chosen, use `statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA` to estimate the coefficients. Review summary statistics to ensure reasonable residual behavior.

## 3. Forecast Evaluation

Evaluate predictions using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). Cross-validation on rolling windows helps confirm that the model generalizes well.

While ARIMA is a classical technique, it remains a powerful baseline and a stepping stone toward more complex forecasting methods.
