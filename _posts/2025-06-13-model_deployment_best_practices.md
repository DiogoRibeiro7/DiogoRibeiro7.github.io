A model is only as valuable as its impact in the real world. Deployment bridges the gap between experimental results and practical applications.

## 1. Containerization

Packaging models in containers such as Docker ensures consistent environments across development and production. This reduces dependency issues and simplifies scaling.

## 2. Monitoring and Logging

Once deployed, models must be monitored for performance degradation and data drift. Logging predictions and input data enables debugging and long-term analysis.

## 3. Continuous Improvement

Retraining pipelines and automated rollback strategies help keep models accurate as data changes over time. MLOps tools streamline these processes, making deployments more robust.
