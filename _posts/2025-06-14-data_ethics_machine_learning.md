title: 'Why Data Ethics Matters in Machine Learning'
---

Machine learning models influence decisions in finance, healthcare, and beyond. Ignoring their ethical implications can lead to harmful outcomes and loss of trust.

## 1. Sources of Bias

Bias often enters through historical data that reflects social inequities. Careful data auditing and diverse datasets help reduce unfair outcomes.

## 2. Transparency and Accountability

Model interpretability techniques and transparent documentation allow stakeholders to understand how predictions are made and to challenge them when necessary.

By considering ethics from the outset, data scientists can create systems that not only perform well but also align with broader societal values.
