## Introduction

Observational error, also known as measurement error, is the difference between a measured value of a quantity and its unknown true value. These errors are inherent in the measurement process and can affect the accuracy and precision of the results.

## Types of Measurement Errors

### Random Errors

- Definition: Random errors lead to inconsistent measurable values when repeated measurements of a constant attribute or quantity are taken.
- Causes: Factors that cannot be controlled, such as environmental changes, slight variations in measurement technique, and inherent variability in the measurement instrument.
- Examples: Fluctuations in temperature affecting a thermometer, slight hand movements when using a ruler.

### Systematic Errors
- Definition: Systematic errors are introduced by repeatable processes inherent to the system and are not determined by chance.
- Causes: Calibration errors, consistent bias in the measurement technique, and defects in the measurement instrument.
- Examples: A scale that is always off by 0.5 kg, a stopwatch that runs slow by a consistent amount of time.

## Statistical Model of Errors
The common statistical model posits that error has two additive parts:
1. **Systematic Error**: Always occurs with the same value under the same conditions.
2. **Random Error**: Varies between observations due to uncontrollable factors.

## Systematic Error: Statistical Bias
- Definition: Systematic error is sometimes called statistical bias.
- Reduction: Often reduced with standardized procedures and calibration.
- Impact: Affects the accuracy of measurements.

## Random Error: Precision
- Definition: Random error is closely related to the concept of precision.
- Impact: The higher the precision of a measurement instrument, the smaller the variability (standard deviation) of the fluctuations in its readings.
- Example: A high-precision scale with minimal fluctuation in repeated measurements.

## Estimating Measurement Uncertainty
- Methods: Statistical analysis, repeated measurements, and calibration against known standards.
- Representation: Typically specified with the measurement, e.g., 32.3 Â± 0.5 cm.
- Importance: Understanding and estimating uncertainty is crucial for reliable and accurate measurements.

## Conclusion
Measurement errors, both random and systematic, are inherent in any measurement process. By understanding their nature and how to estimate and reduce them, more accurate and precise measurements can be achieved.
