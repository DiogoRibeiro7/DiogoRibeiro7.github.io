# 15 Article Ideas on Statistical Tests

Here are some interesting article ideas centered around statistical tests, designed to help you explore the differences, applications, and nuances of various statistical methods:

### 1. **"T-Test vs. Z-Test: When and Why to Use Each"**
   - Explain the differences between the t-test and z-test.
   - Discuss when each test is appropriate based on sample size, variance, and distribution.
   - Provide real-world applications for each test.
   - Explore one-sample, two-sample, and paired t-tests.

### 2. **"Chi-Square Test: Applications in Categorical Data Analysis"**
   - Overview of the chi-square test for independence and goodness of fit.
   - Discuss the assumptions and limitations of the chi-square test.
   - Explore how the test is applied in real-world cases (e.g., surveys, contingency tables).
   - Comparison with other methods for categorical data (e.g., Fisher’s exact test).

### 3. **"Paired vs. Independent Samples: Understanding the Differences in Hypothesis Testing"**
   - Explain the differences between paired and independent samples.
   - Discuss when to use paired t-tests, independent t-tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
   - Explore practical examples in clinical trials, before-and-after studies, etc.

### 4. **"Power Analysis: How to Determine Sample Size for Hypothesis Testing"**
   - Introduction to statistical power and its importance in hypothesis testing.
   - Discuss the relationship between sample size, effect size, and significance level.
   - Provide an overview of how to perform power analysis in different tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA).

### 5. **"Mann-Whitney U Test vs. Independent T-Test: Non-Parametric Alternatives"**
   - Comparison between the parametric t-test and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.
   - Explain when and why to use the Mann-Whitney U test (e.g., non-normal distributions).
   - Provide practical examples and real-world applications of each test.

### 6. **"One-Way ANOVA vs. Two-Way ANOVA: When to Use Which"**
   - Overview of the one-way and two-way ANOVA tests.
   - Discuss scenarios where two-way ANOVA is preferred (interaction effects between two factors).
   - Explore how to interpret main effects and interactions in a two-way ANOVA.

### 7. **"Hypothesis Testing with Small Samples: Exploring the Sign Test"**
   - Discuss hypothesis testing for small sample sizes when parametric assumptions are not met.
   - Explain how the sign test works as a non-parametric test.
   - Compare the sign test with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and other small-sample tests.

### 8. **"Levene's Test vs. Bartlett’s Test: Checking for Homogeneity of Variances"**
   - Comparison of Levene's and Bartlett’s tests for checking homogeneity of variances in data.
   - Discuss when to use each test (parametric vs. non-parametric, normal vs. non-normal data).
   - Application in conjunction with ANOVA and other tests that assume equal variances.

### 9. **"Multiple Comparisons Problem: Bonferroni Correction and Other Solutions"**
   - Explain the multiple comparisons problem that arises in hypothesis testing.
   - Discuss the Bonferroni correction and other methods (e.g., Holm-Bonferroni, FDR).
   - Show practical applications in experiments with multiple testing (e.g., medical studies, genetics).

### 10. **"Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test: Assessing Goodness-of-Fit in Non-Parametric Data"**
   - Introduction to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test for checking distribution fit.
   - Compare K-S test with other goodness-of-fit tests like Shapiro-Wilk.
   - Explore real-world use cases, such as testing if a dataset follows a specific distribution.

### 11. **"Cochran’s Q Test: Comparing Three or More Related Proportions"**
   - Overview of Cochran’s Q test for comparing proportions in related groups.
   - Explain when Cochran’s Q test is appropriate, particularly in binary data.
   - Discuss the test’s relationship with McNemar’s test and logistic regression.

### 12. **"Log-Rank Test in Survival Analysis: Comparing Survival Curves"**
   - Introduction to the log-rank test used in survival analysis.
   - Discuss its applications in medical studies to compare survival times between two groups.
   - Explain how to interpret survival curves and the p-values from a log-rank test.
