## Mary Jackson: NASA's First Black Female Engineer and Advocate for Diversity

**Mary Jackson** (1921–2005) was a pioneering African American mathematician and aerospace engineer who made history as NASA’s **first Black female engineer**. Known for her critical contributions to NASA’s **aerodynamics** research during the early space race, Jackson also became a champion for diversity and inclusion in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (**STEM**). Over her long career at NASA, Jackson helped break down barriers for women and minorities, leaving behind a legacy of both technical achievements and advocacy for equality.

### Early Life and Education

Mary Jackson (née Winston) was born on **April 9, 1921**, in **Hampton, Virginia**. Growing up in the segregated South, Jackson faced the challenges of racial discrimination from a young age. Despite these obstacles, she excelled academically and graduated with honors from **Hampton Institute** (now Hampton University) in 1942 with a degree in **mathematics** and **physical science**.

After college, Jackson worked as a schoolteacher and later held jobs as a receptionist and a bookkeeper, but she continued to pursue opportunities in science and engineering. In 1951, she was hired by the **National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics** (**NACA**), the organization that would later become NASA, marking the beginning of her remarkable career in aeronautics.

### A Trailblazer at NASA

Jackson started her career at NACA as a **mathematician** in the **West Area Computing** unit at Langley Research Center, where she worked under **Dorothy Vaughan** alongside other talented women known as **human computers**. These women were responsible for performing the complex calculations necessary for NASA's aerodynamics research. Their work, often done by hand, played a vital role in the development of aircraft and spacecraft technology.

Jackson’s talents quickly became apparent, and she was soon assigned to work with engineer **Kazimierz Czarnecki** in Langley’s Supersonic Pressure Tunnel. There, she conducted experiments and analyzed data on **airflow dynamics** and **aerodynamics**. Czarnecki recognized Jackson’s potential and encouraged her to pursue an engineering degree to advance her career.

### Becoming NASA’s First Black Female Engineer

In 1958, after completing a challenging engineering training program that required her to obtain special permission to attend classes at the then-segregated **University of Virginia** at night, Jackson was promoted to **aerospace engineer** at NASA. This made her NASA’s **first Black female engineer**, a groundbreaking achievement at a time when both racial and gender discrimination were pervasive in American society.

As an engineer, Jackson specialized in **aerodynamics** and **airflow analysis**. Her work involved conducting experiments in NASA's wind tunnels and analyzing data that contributed to the design of more efficient and effective aircraft and spacecraft. She authored and co-authored numerous technical papers on topics such as **drag reduction** and **turbulence in airflow**, making significant contributions to NASA’s early space missions.

### Champion for Diversity and Inclusion

Although Jackson excelled in her engineering career, she faced persistent barriers due to her race and gender. Rather than be discouraged, she became a vocal advocate for change. In the 1970s, Jackson made the bold decision to take a demotion to become a **Langley’s Federal Women’s Program Manager**. In this role, she worked tirelessly to influence hiring and promotion practices at NASA, ensuring that more women and minorities could advance in STEM fields.

Jackson mentored and encouraged countless women and African Americans to pursue careers in engineering and science, providing guidance and support to those who, like her, faced systemic discrimination. She became a role model, embodying the belief that with hard work, perseverance, and education, individuals could break through barriers and succeed in STEM.

### Hidden Figures and Recognition

Mary Jackson’s story, along with those of her colleagues **Dorothy Vaughan** and **Katherine Johnson**, was brought to public attention in the 2016 book and film **Hidden Figures**, which highlighted the crucial, yet often overlooked, contributions of Black women mathematicians and engineers at NASA during the space race. The film portrayed Jackson’s determination and brilliance, and her role in breaking racial and gender barriers at NASA became widely celebrated.

In 2019, NASA honored Jackson’s legacy by renaming its headquarters in Washington, D.C., the **Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters**. This recognition was a fitting tribute to a woman who not only made significant contributions to aerospace engineering but also worked relentlessly to ensure that future generations would have the opportunities she had fought for.

### Legacy and Impact

Mary Jackson’s legacy as a mathematician, engineer, and advocate for equality continues to inspire people around the world. Her work helped lay the foundation for the success of NASA’s early space missions, and her efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in STEM opened doors for countless women and minorities in science and engineering.

Jackson’s career is a testament to the power of perseverance and the importance of advocating for change. She believed that education and opportunity should be available to everyone, regardless of race or gender, and her commitment to breaking down barriers helped pave the way for future generations of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.

### Conclusion

Mary Jackson’s life and career are a powerful reminder of the impact that one person can have on both their field and society as a whole. As NASA’s first Black female engineer, she made significant contributions to aerodynamics and space exploration, while also championing the rights of women and minorities in STEM. Her legacy as a trailblazer in both engineering and advocacy continues to inspire new generations of scientists, engineers, and leaders.
