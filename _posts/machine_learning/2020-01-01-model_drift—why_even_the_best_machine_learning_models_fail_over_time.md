## Introduction to Model Drift

Machine learning (ML) models are often deployed with high initial accuracy, but over time, their performance can degrade. This phenomenon, known as **model drift**, occurs when the statistical properties of the data change, making the model's original assumptions less valid. Unlike traditional software, ML models do not have static logic; they rely on patterns learned from historical data. When these patterns shift, the model struggles to make reliable predictions.

Model drift is a major concern in production ML systems, particularly in dynamic environments such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. The consequences of model drift can range from minor inefficiencies to catastrophic failures, such as incorrect medical diagnoses, financial losses, or security breaches. Understanding **why** models fail over time and **how** to detect and mitigate drift is critical for maintaining robust AI systems.

## Causes of Model Drift

Understanding the causes of model drift helps in designing proactive strategies to mitigate it. The primary causes include:

1. **Evolving Real-World Conditions**  
   - Economic shifts, regulatory changes, and consumer behavior evolution impact ML models.  
   - Example: A stock prediction model built in a bull market may fail during a recession.

2. **External Shocks**  
   - Unforeseen events, such as pandemics or financial crises, can render ML models obsolete.  
   - Example: COVID-19 disrupted ML models in supply chain forecasting, making previous patterns irrelevant.

3. **Data Quality Issues**  
   - Missing data, data bias, and inconsistencies in data sources can lead to drift.  
   - Example: If an automated data pipeline starts including erroneous records, model predictions will degrade.

4. **Regulatory and Compliance Changes**  
   - New laws affecting data collection and model usage can indirectly cause model drift.  
   - Example: GDPR restrictions on user tracking can impact personalization models.

## Case Studies on Model Drift in Production

### **Finance: Algorithmic Trading**
- High-frequency trading models failed during market volatility in 2020 due to outdated training data.

### **Healthcare: AI in Medical Diagnosis**
- AI models trained on pre-pandemic patient data struggled with COVID-19-related health conditions.

### **Cybersecurity: Threat Detection Systems**
- ML-based intrusion detection systems became ineffective as cybercriminals developed more sophisticated attack techniques.
