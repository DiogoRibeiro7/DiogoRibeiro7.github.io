			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Data Scientist combining classical statistical approaches with more modern machine learning methods.

<p>I'm a data scientist with 10 years of experience in research and in leading new software projects, data mining and machine learning. I enjoy working on using Big Data stream mining and large-scale data analysis to gain insights from Big Data. I design and build applications on real-time data mining, at the intersection of mathematics, data science, algorithms, and business. My work Catalog spans across Europe, UK and US.</p>

<p>I have two degrees in mathematics, one in Pure Mathematics and the other in Applied Mathematics. This degrees gave me an solid mathematical preparation, skills and ingenuity in mathematical modeling techniques like machine learning, computer fluid dynamics, data mining, time series and regression that can suit a wide range of applications in various branches of economy and industry and facilitated the use of computational and numerical techniques applications. With excellent skills in computer simulation using Monte Carlo methods.</p>

<p>I have extensive experience using applied statistics in machine learning with techniques such as deep learning, natural language processing, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and neural networking (CNN/ ANN). My programming language competency includes, Python, R, Sql , Matlab and C/C++. My skillset also includes use of Qlik Sense, SSRS, Power BI, SSIS and Tableau.</p>
